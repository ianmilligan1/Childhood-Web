# Unlocking Childrens and Youth History through Computational Big Data

Ian Milligan (University of Waterloo)

Studying childhood history is difficult because children do not, by and large, leave sources behind. Information about their lives is filtered through lenses: the lenses of adulthood, when we study representations of kids written by adults, or reminscing upon their memories; or the state; or idealized visions in art, school curricula, and the like. We have newspaper reporters describing children playing, sociological reports if we are lucky, and cultural histories of rhymes and paintings. While exceptions exist, such as diaries, this has generally been a limitation of childhood history (handled ably and sensitively by youth and childhood historians).

All of that has begun to dramatically change. The advent of the World Wide Web offers a publishing platform to millions, now billions, of users that would not have ended up in the historical record. It has a global reach, with over [three billion people now having access to the Internet](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32884867). And it grows at an exponential rate. [Google alone](http://lintool.github.io/my-data-is-bigger-than-your-data/) sees 100 hours of YouTube video added every minute, and queries over 100,000 TBs of information every time you run a search index. While much of this data is transient or will not survive for the future benefit of historians, even the minority that is being saved will represent a significant shift.

Since 1996, the Internet Archive has collected over 400 billion web objects (https://twitter.com/brewster_kahle/status/439414396108800000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Many of these have been written by children and youth, representing a significant shift in the kinds of primary sources that are now available to youth and childhood historians.

This short paper explores this shift through the primary lens of the GeoCities.com "Enchanted Forest." GeoCities.com, founded in 1994, rose by the late 1990s to be the third most popular website in the world through its simple yet powerful approach of giving people a free web publishing platform: a megabyte of their own, simple tools to build content, all supported by advertisements. While it was shuttered by Yahoo! corporation in 2009 – today if you visit GeoCities.com you'll see no evidence that seven million once made it their online home – web archivists captured it so that we can today study it. As part of their approach to community, GeoCities created a heavily-policed and monitored section of their page dedciated to children. Today, we can use that as a starting point to inquire what this means to childhood and youth historians.

## Online Primary Sources: From my First Trace to the Enchanted Forest

A useful thought experiment to begin teasing this out is to think of your own online traces: can you find yoour first online adventures today, either in the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web) or elsewhere? Would this material have exited before? 

On 12 July 1995, an eleven-year old boy wrote a [USENET post](http://www.usenet.org/) in the `rec.games.miniatures.warhammer` newsgroup. The [question](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.miniatures.warhammer/lBXtRaahGzc), about a "civil war" scenario that he had played with some friends recently, is inconsequential; but its existence is not. That was my first online trace of the past left behind by myself. A suburban, middle-class boy leaving behind some of his thoughts from a Grade 6 board game. By the standards of traditional archives and special collections, this is not a consequential record to obtain. Yet the Web is full of them.

On its own, the 11-year-old-authored USENET post is not a remarkable historical source: it's a datapoint that might not tell you much on its own, even if you were able to discern the age of the author. But it forms part of an aggregate, Big Data resource of what we are doing that can shed new and remarkable light on human culture and activity.

Individually, the source is meaningless. On a scale of hundreds of thousands or beyond, it is part of a tapestry that can tell us something about the interests and activities of young people in the mid-1990s.

Accessing web archives is currently quite difficult. Outside of smaller collections, such as those gathered by the Internet Archive's [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/) service, most users are limited to using the Wayback Machine. The largest such one is [provided by the Internet Archive](http://archive.org/web/),
