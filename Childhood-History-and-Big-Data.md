# Unlocking Childhood and Youth History through Computational Big Data

Ian Milligan (University of Waterloo)

“Welcome to the Enchanted Forest,” the page read, “home of the littlest GeoCitizens and some of the best homepages. This is a neighbourhood for pages by kids, for kids – from animals to zephyrs, the Forest has everything that a young mind could need.”[1] An experiment in online publishing was playing out, amidst a broader context of fears around undifferentiated accessibility to adult content and online exploitation: GeoCities’ Enchanted Forest. This geographically-represented online community had everything a child, parent, or educator could need: the ability to reach large audiences, but patrolled by volunteer community leaders, resources provided at community centers, and spirit-building awards and contests. The virtual suburbs spread out across the vistas, offering their own community leaders, centers, and blocks full of websites. For thousands of children and their families, Enchanted Forest was a means to reach audiences – and historians – that previous generations of children could only imagine.

Studying childhood history is difficult because children do not, by and large, leave sources behind. Information about their lives is filtered through lenses: the lenses of adulthood, when we study representations of kids written by adults, or reminscing upon their memories; or the state; or idealized visions in art, school curricula, and the like. We have newspaper reporters describing children playing, sociological reports if we are lucky, and cultural histories of rhymes and paintings. While exceptions exist, such as diaries, this has generally been a limitation of childhood history (handled ably and sensitively by youth and childhood historians).

All of that has begun to dramatically change. The advent of the World Wide Web offers a publishing platform to millions, now billions, of users that would not have ended up in the historical record. It has a global reach, with over [three billion people now having access to the Internet](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32884867). And it grows at an exponential rate. [Google alone](http://lintool.github.io/my-data-is-bigger-than-your-data/) sees 100 hours of YouTube video added every minute, and queries over 100,000 TBs of information every time you run a search index. While much of this data is transient or will not survive for the future benefit of historians, even the minority that is being saved will represent a significant shift.

Since 1996, the Internet Archive has collected over 400 billion web objects (https://twitter.com/brewster_kahle/status/439414396108800000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Many of these have been written by children and youth, representing a significant shift in the kinds of primary sources that are now available to youth and childhood historians.

This short paper explores this shift through the primary lens of the GeoCities.com "Enchanted Forest." GeoCities.com, founded in 1994, rose by the late 1990s to be the third most popular website in the world through its simple yet powerful approach of giving people a free web publishing platform: a megabyte of their own, simple tools to build content, all supported by advertisements. While it was shuttered by Yahoo! corporation in 2009 – today if you visit GeoCities.com you'll see no evidence that seven million once made it their online home – web archivists captured it so that we can today study it. As part of their approach to community, GeoCities created a heavily-policed and monitored section of their page dedciated to children. Today, we can use that as a starting point to inquire what this means to childhood and youth historians.

## Online Primary Sources: From my First Trace to the Enchanted Forest

A useful thought experiment to begin teasing this out is to think of your own online traces: can you find yoour first online adventures today, either in the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web) or elsewhere? Would this material have exited before? 

On 12 July 1995, an eleven-year old boy wrote a [USENET post](http://www.usenet.org/) in the `rec.games.miniatures.warhammer` newsgroup. The [question](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.miniatures.warhammer/lBXtRaahGzc), about a "civil war" scenario that he had played with some friends recently, is inconsequential; but its existence is not. That was my first online trace of the past left behind by myself. A suburban, middle-class boy leaving behind some of his thoughts from a Grade 6 board game. By the standards of traditional archives and special collections, this is not a consequential record to obtain. Yet the Web is full of them.

On its own, the 11-year-old-authored USENET post is not a remarkable historical source: it's a datapoint that might not tell you much on its own, even if you were able to discern the age of the author. But it forms part of an aggregate, Big Data resource of what we are doing that can shed new and remarkable light on human culture and activity.

Individually, the source is meaningless. On a scale of hundreds of thousands or beyond, it is part of a tapestry that can tell us something about the interests and activities of young people in the mid-1990s. As the *New York Times* noted in 1997, the web was not just made by dot.com companies Silicon Valley, that “eleven-year-old boys and grandmothers are also busy putting up Web sites. Of course, the quality of these sites varies greatly, but low-cost and even free home page services are a growing part of the on-line world.”[2]

Accessing web archives is currently quite difficult. Outside of smaller collections, such as those gathered by the Internet Archive's [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/) service, most users are limited to using the Wayback Machine. The largest such one is [provided by the Internet Archive](http://archive.org/web/), letting you access old webpages if you know the specific URL of the item that you are looking for. That, however, can be difficult to find and does not scale for large-scale research.

We need to instead turn to specific collections. One of these is GeoCities, the publishing platform. Saved in 2009 by Archive Team, and preserved between 1996 and 2009 by the Internet Archive, the now-defunct GeoCities offers a fertile platform for experimentation with web archives. In 2015, based on a research agreement signed between my research team and the Internet Archive, we were able to secure the WebARChive (WARC) files that comprise the GeoCities.com collection. 

## What was the GeoCities Enchanted Forest?

From its inception, GeoCities really was a *Geo*Cities. The geographical metaphor lay at the hart of the website. GeoCities was divided into a series of "neighbourhoods," divided into user interests. Heartland, the largest neighbourhood, was intended for those with interests in "families, pets, hometown values"; Wellesley, for feminist and women's issues; WestHollywood for LGBT concerns. They were not optional (apart from a miniscule amount of people who paid for "vanity" URLs, such as http://geocities.com/myname): users intending to build a GeoCities page had to pursue a long list of various neighbourhoods, find one that fit their uses, see some other example topics, before phyiscally moving in by selecting an address in the neighbourhood between 1000 and 9999. As popular neighbourhoods, "suburbs" began to appear. 

![Neighbourhoods, 1996](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianmilligan1/Childhood-Web/master/Images/Fig1-Neighbourhoods.png)
Fig 1: List of 29 Neighbourhoods, 20 December 1996, archived at <http://web.archive.org/web/19961220165942/http://www.geocities.com/homestead/homedir.html>. 

One of these neighbourhoods was the Enchanted Forest. As Jack Schofield noted in the *Guardian*, it was a different sort of neighbourhood. Rather than gathering users by their interests (as in WestHollywood or Wellesley), "it divided its users based on their age."[3]

What was it like to move in here? The dynamic site building experience for GeoCities has been lost, unfortunately, but evidence has been preserved from elsewhere. In the New York Times, journalist Michelle Slatalla wrote about how she created an Enchanted Forest page with her two daughters, Zoe and Ella, aged 9 and 7 respectively. It was a smooth, accessible experience:

>We found an empty ''cottage'' to claim. From Geocities' main page, we clicked on Help and got easy-to-follow instructions on how to call up a template to edit our home page. Offered a choice of editing tools that included both an HTML editor and a simplified editor that hid all the scaffolding, my daughters began to experiment. Instead of typing commands in HTML, or hypertext markup language, the lingua franca of the Web, they could use pull-down menus to choose text color and graphics elements. What they liked most, though, was simply to type text. ''Here is a list of things that Zoe likes,'' Zoe began.[4]

They subsequently discovered the line break element (`<br>`) – “Mom, is that code?” asked Ella – and they began to look into the source code of the page they were creating. “Before my eyes,” Slatalla wrote, “my first grader was grasping an essential concept about how information is created, organized, and displayed on the Internet. … Forget French: we should all be teaching our kids HTML."[5]

## Studying Children without their Consent: Ethical Ironies within GeoCities

When studying web archives, one must be mindful of ethics at all time. I have explored this more in depth elsewhere, but in short, these are archives 

There was a darker side to GeoCities, however. Some children joined the GeoKidz club, which was prominently marketed throughout the Enchanted Forest splash page and other administrative spaces. It was actually at EnhcantedForest/3696, run by a third party, but prominent language on the hompage implored users to go visit.

To enter competitions or other clubs, prospective members had to fill out surveys: these were fun adventures, replete with “bouncing ballons” or toys. The questions, however, were a bit less fun according to Moira Scollay, the Australian federal privacy commissioner:

>Part of it might ask them does daddy play golf, how many clubs does he have, do you have a cat or dog, how many rooms in your house, do you have a car, does mummy and daddy drive, and how many cars do they have.[6]

As she noted, this was “complete exploitation of children … it’s now not just pornography, it’s marketing as well.”[7]

## Finding Popular Sites through Network Analysis

The Enchanted Forest was an interconnected community, stitched together by a whopping 748,563 hyperlinks between 67,453 HTML pages spread across 9,460 individual user pages. Link structures can also help find the most popular sites within the community, as measured by hyperlinks. A site that was linked to by ten other websites, for example, was one that had made some connections; by hundreds, and we found community leaders or other network hubs. The scope of this collection can be seen below in Fig X:

![Link Structure](https://github.com/ianmilligan1/Childhood-Web/raw/master/Images/Fig2-Link-Structures.png)
Fig X: The 748,563 edges of the Enchanted Forest, connecting the 67,453 HTML pages.

Note the darker coloured clusters: these are websites that have a high-degree of inbound links. In this visualization, a site that many other sites *within* the Enchanted Forest linked to, will have a darker and bolder colour. They are other coloured based upon their modularity class, the product of a community-detection algorithm to find sites that might be similar based solely on their linking practices. 

While this sort of visualization is often derided as being in the spaghetti-and-meatballs vein, we can learn quite a bit from it as we move between the level of distant and close reading. Remember the major problem: we have too many websites to read them all. Accordingly, we can then either generate lists of the websites that had the most inbound links, or we can zoom in to explore these clusters manually. Again, we’re not looking at 67,453 pages: but looking at the ones that most pique our interest. The most dominant ones (the two large yellow dots pictured above) are actually links to the “welcome to GeoCities” image. Yet the clusters of websites are interesting, revealing some of the most popular sites within the Enchanted Forest as measured by links. Consider when we zoom in below as in Fig X:

![Link Structure zoomed in](https://github.com/ianmilligan1/Childhood-Web/raw/master/Images/Fig3-Zooming-in-Links.png)
Fig X: Zooming into a Cluster of Websites

The circle is a cluster of webring-related sites. And other sites, such as Prairie/2524, Prairie/2524, and Dell/4543 – for example  – are also worth looking into, as they had a substantial number of inbound links.

I decided to use this visualization to explore some of the most popular sites, and they’re revealing about the various uses of the Enchanted Forest. They ran the gamut from those aimed at children, those that built community either through services or award provision, and – of course – those written by children themselves. What they generally shared was a tight connection into the GeoCities ecosystem: they had received numerous awards, shared avatars with others, became featured pages, and generally threw themselves into the vibrant community that was forming.

The websites written by the children themselves are interesting. Brandon’s page, at Dell/4543 (seen above) is worth exploring in detail. Like many other websites, it was active until some point in 2001, when it ceased to be updated any further (Brandon was 10 years old in April 2001, and his age remained unchanged on the home page until the closure in 2009). His home page was an introduction to himself:

>Hi! My name is Brandon. I am 10 years old. As you can tell from the music, I am a big fan of Star Wars. My hobbies include baseball (I hate that my season is over), football, watching nascar races (my favorite driver is Ernie Ervin), riding my bike, and playing my games. My favorite game on Virtual Boy is Mario Tennis, Sonic and Knuckles on Sega Genesis, Willy Beamish on Sega CD, Teenage Mutant turtles on Super Ninetendo [sic], and Star wars on 32x. When I grow up, I want to be a baseball player. We live in S.C. I would like to hear from you![9]

Elsewhere on his page, he had an aquarium page – “my mom won't let me and my sister have an aquarium … so this is what we came up with.” – which was a watery-background page with dozens of animated fish GIFs. He also had other pages, such as one focusing on Batman and another on Spiderman, mostly consisting of pictures and frames from the movies. An extensive Star Wars site makes for interesting viewing as well, connected to many other sites through two webrings that Brandon maintained. More crucially, Brandon also received thirty-six awards from other users, stretching back to his first award on 31 July 1997: most of these were from other kids on the Web, although some were from adults or others (“Clara’s Special Children’s Award” which offered “a prayer for you [and] blessings all year through”). Brandon was part of this eco-system too, offering his own “Batman” award that other people could have: they would need to fill out a form to apply for the award, consisting of their name, e-mail address, homepage, what it’s about, and probably most important, whether or not they signed his guestbook. Some twenty-five people received his award, other kids: “fellow treasure hunters,” Power Ranges or Will Smith fan sites, Peter Pan, and so forth. This was a connected individual.

Other well-connected sites fell into a different category, that of websites written – purportedly by children – but really by their parents.  **MORE HERE**


Community leaders were ubiquitous throughout GeoCities, providing the sense of community that glued the website together. Purportedly growing out of user demand, these leaders were given the mandate to “take an active role in shaping their neighbourhoods,” by responding to questions by e-mail, running award programs to nominate and select best sites, police content guidelines, help new users learn the basics of HTML and GeoCities pages, liaise with GeoCities staff, and monitor communication mediums like chat rooms and discussion boards.[8]

## Conclusions

The Enchanted Forest died two deaths. 

**FIRST DEATH: YAHOO purchase and decline in 2000s**

![last modified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianmilligan1/Childhood-Web/master/Images/Fig4-LastModified.png)
Fig X: Slow dwindling of activity

The second death came with Yahoo!’s decision in 2009 to shutter GeoCities for good. By that point, user numbers were down, media attention had passed, and GeoCities had become synonymous with “bad taste” among many Web denizens. Most sites explored had not been updated since the late 1990s or early 2000s, and were already digital ruins of stale, dated material.

Not all, though. Some former hubs registered their protest. Perhaps the most poignant came from the former Glade subdivision community centre, which closed down with a large font protest:

>Yahoo got rid of us! Sorry but we do not exist anymore. We haven't in a long time now. Yahoo doesn't care about the kids anymore. Pedophiles and porno sickos can now run rampid and there's nothing anyone at Yahoo is gonna do! They just don't care about the safety of children. All they care about is numbers and money! May God have mercy on them all![10]
